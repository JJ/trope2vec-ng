abstract = {We analyze the style and structure of story narrative using the case of film scripts. The practical importance of this is noted, especially the need to have support tools for television movie writing. We use the Casablanca film script, and scripts from six episodes of CSI (Crime Scene Investigation). For analysis of style and structure, we quantify various central perspectives discussed in McKee's book, Story: Substance, Structure, Style, and the Principles of Screenwriting. Film scripts offer a useful point of departure for exploration of the analysis of more general narratives. Our methodology, using Correspondence Analysis and hierarchical clustering, is innovative in a range of areas that we discuss. In particular this work is groundbreaking in taking the qualitative analysis of McKee and grounding this analysis in a quantitative and algorithmic framework.}

abstract="A general overview is provided through examples and case studies, retrieved from research experiences, to foster description and debate on effectiveness in Big Data environments. At issue are early stage case studies relating to: research publishing and research impact; literature, narrative and foundational emotional tracking; and social media, here Twitter, with a social science orientation. Central relevance and importance will be associated with the following aspects of analytical methodology: context, leading to availing of semantics; focus, motivating homology between fields of analytical orientation; resolution scale, which can incorporate a concept hierarchy and aggregation in general; and acknowledging all that is implied by this expression: correlation is not causation. Application areas are: quantitative and also qualitative assessment, narrative analysis and assessing impact, and baselining and contextualizing, statistically and in related aspects such as visualization.",
