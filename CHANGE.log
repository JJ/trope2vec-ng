## [Unreleased] - 2020-02-24 7:46
### Created
  - New release including files with 200 dimensions vectors associated to tropes
    To obtain this file, download tropes2vec.tgz from release v0.0.3 assets
    and access to folder output/max_tropes_15_ngrams_9_inc_film_name_0/
    to see file vectors in format <trope_name> <200 dims vector>
    - tropes_200_dim_vectors_15_taken_9_min-count_1.txt
    - tropes_200_dim_vectors_15_taken_9_min-count_3.txt
    - tropes_200_dim_vectors_15_taken_9_min-count_5.txt
 
    and error file with tropes without associated vectors
    - errors_tropes_set_15_taken_9_min-count_3.txt
    - errors_tropes_set_15_taken_9_min-count_5.txt
    
    If you need a vector for each trope take file with min_cout_1

### Created
  - New files set (bin, ngram, film subset, tropes subset) 
    for different (MAX_TROPES, NGRAM_SIZE): (16,9), (15,9) and (12,7) are
    included in output dir. To check this file download tgz file in release files V0.0.2
  - New files set (bin, ngram, film subset, tropes subset) for different 
    (MAX_TROPES, NGRAM_SIZE, MIN_COUNT): (15,9,5), (15,9,3) and (15,9,1)
    MIN_COUNT parameter let to word2vec program remove words less than the
    indicated number.
  - Three files in output/max_tropes_15_ngrams_9_inc_film_name_0/ created using 
    scripts/tv-tropes-word2vec.py with 200 dim vectors using bin files created with 
    1, 3 and 5 min_count value.
    In case of min_count=1 all tropes have a vector
    In case of min_count=3 1787 have no associated vector
    In case of min_count=5 1211 have no associated vector 
  
### Modified 
  - iccc.tex to include a table with information about created files

## [Unreleased] - 2020-02-23 0:08

### Changed 
 - Modified scripts/tvtropes.pl to generate ngrams file from films with tropes number between max_tropes and 2
   Previous version only generate string form max_tropes to ngram_size, and any film with less than ngram_size
   tropes was removed.

### Created
  - new ngram files including films with less than <ngram_size> tropes
  - new file model using word2vec for new ngram file
